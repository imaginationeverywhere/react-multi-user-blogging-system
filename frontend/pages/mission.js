        <p>
            BWNC is a solution-oriented multimedia roundtable guided by unapologetic and unfiltered minds that THINK BLACK and LIVE BLACK. Our goal is to document the all-encompassing Black experience, specifically in the United States, but throughout the entire African diaspora by building, sustaining, and protecting a safe platform for Black voices to be heard and understood.
        </p>
        <p>
        We document the Diasporaâ€™s cultural experiences globally through storytelling, content creation, content curation & social advocacy to shift narratives and paradigms. We aim to inform & inspire through dynamic, creative, & transformative content.
